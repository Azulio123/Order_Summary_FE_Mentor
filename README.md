Overview
The challenge
Users should be able to:

See hover states for interactive elements
Screenshot


Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like FireShot to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

What I learned
Used landmarks, which hopefully won't return any annpoying errors this time. Used more accessible coding (aria!) Did not use a library and just pure HTML and CSS. Continued learning the dark art of centering things (will I ever master it?). I did, in fact, code this for mobile view first. I am no longer a mongoloid with a big screen fancy.


Continued development
Definitely getting the hang of having a process. I haven't refactored my code yet, but will soon. Let's get this puppy on the internet first!

Dev.to was pretty helpful. My husband cheered me on. I didn't need a tonne of help this time. Also, the feedback from frontend mentor has really been awesome.
